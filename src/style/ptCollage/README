This file is a modified Qt StyleSheet file, and it will not work with other Qt apps.
The difference is, this file has a variable system, and it is parsed at runtime.

Example 1:

	Var1 = #00FF00
	Var2 = red
	---
	QWidget {
		background-color: Var1;
		border: 1px solid Var2;
	}

This will cause the background color of every widget to be green, and have a red border.

Variables are simple plaintext drop-ins. They can be used for lots of things, for example:

	ImageDir = style/demoStyle/image
	---
	QMainWindow {
		background-image: url("ImageDir/image.png");
	}

This will cause the main window to have an awful, gawdy strecthed & artifacted version of
"(path of ptcollab executable)/style/demoStyle/image/image.png" as its background.

The variables technically support spaces, but I wouldn't recommend using them that way.
You won't have much luck, as the stylesheet engine will just think it's 2  different keywords.

You can create more styles by putting them in the directory above this one (ptcollab/styles/)
and using this format.
