ptcollab styles are created using Qt Stylesheets. Any custom objects you would want to style can
be found in the source code (https://github.com/yuxshao/ptcollab). Everything else (the majority)
that can be styled will use these guidelines (https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-reference.html).

You can create more styles by putting them in the directory above this one (ptcollab/styles/) and
using this format (/style/StyleName/StyleName.qss). You also need a palette.ini - see the default
style for reference. A style can be selected from within the settings menu, given your .qss file's
name is the same as its containing folder.
