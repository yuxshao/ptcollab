ptcollab styles are created using Qt Stylesheets. Any custom objects you would want to style can
be found in the source code (https://github.com/yuxshao/ptcollab). Everything else (the majority)
that can be styled will use these guidelines (https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-reference.html).

You can create more styles by putting them in the directory above this one (ptcollab/styles/) and
using this format (/style/StyleName/StyleName.qss). You also need a palette.ini - see the default
style for reference. A style can be selected from within the settings menu, given your .qss file's
name is the same as its containing folder.


If your stylesheet contains errors, ptcollab will not be able to detect them until the stylesheet
is already applied (it is an issue with Qt). Depending on the scope of the errors, a few things 
will happen making it apparent what the issue is.

No style applied:
	This means that the stylesheet has a top-level error (usually an error in a selector list or
	a stray character in the topmost level of the stylesheet -- outside of all brackets).

Incomplete styling of a particular object(s):
	This means that the stylesheet for those objects could not be parsed properly, and it is an
	error in the code within any brackets for those selectors. Check that you didn't miss
	parentheses or a semicolon.

Everything that hasn't been explicitly styled is black:
	The required palette.ini file is absent or unreadable.
